# (Portfolio task) HTML & CSS

This is the first coding project and it's about learning HTML & CSS.

## Description

Imitating e-commerce with code that is hard coded to make a look alike e-commerce. Certain functionality requiring JavaScript are mimicked.

- In Jackets page you see the first jacket 'Add to Cart' button is green, and the button text is changed to 'Added to cart'.

- In 'Shopping Cart(1)' you see there is 1 item added permanenlty. This is the part of the mimicking of JavaScript we don't use here.
